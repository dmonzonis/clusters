# open-cluster-verification

Sampedro's data for the 1876 identified open clusters can be found [here](http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/MNRAS/470/3937/clusters), and individual star data for all the stars in the clusters can be found [here](http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/MNRAS/470/3937/catalog). This data can be downloaded as a binary FITS format, and is the data used by the script.
